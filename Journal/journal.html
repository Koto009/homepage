<h2>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House | 8. 29. 23 |</h2>

<p>It’s interesting that the article talks about the “current” climate for web design, but this article was written in 2018 and is now 2023. I do believe that the system or laws to facilitate online activity are very outdated and it reminds me that last year there was a significant concern in data security with TikTok and people started to question the other apps. Still, no new data security regulation legislation was put into place. Laurel’s point about, “ we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future”, stood out to me. I watched a documentary on Netflix called Social Dilemma in 2020 when it first came out, and people who used to work at Google admitted that even their emailing system was designed for people to get hooked on it. To constantly have people scrolling and checking their apps, they limit social apps from their kids for fear of online addiction.</p>

<p>I read this article last semester in Core Studio 4 and it was nice to reread it after the finished project was made. It reminded me that most people take inventions as granted and that building something from hand is pretty difficult. We rely on lighters to light campfires, but it’s entirely possible to use friction to generate enough heat to light the campfire. When I was building my machine for core 4 last year, I created a rotating stand from cardboard. It was a lot of trial and error from videos from YouTube, but it was satisfying to build something from a simple material such as cardboard.  </p>

<p>I like how the author makes connections between web design and designing books. Each line of code was carefully thought out and used to express yourself, instead of making a website to serve a specific purpose. </p>

<p>I first thought is I liked the simple watercolor drawings that contrast with this deep idea that humans were the first computers.  </p>

<p>The page is simple at first and gets very overwhelming with multiple tabs with the pinging sounds. In the same way, I feel overwhelmed in group chats, where fast conversations happen and it’s hard to jump in. I had to mute the website because reading the existing chats would be difficult with the pinging noises. I realize that I cannot control myself when I hear notifications, I always have to read them right away. I guess that is why my phone is usually on silent mode and it has to be that way when I go to sleep.     </p>

<p>Personally this reading was a bit hard for me to understand, but I reread it and wanted to point out the things I understood or had questions about. I found it really scary that a group of scientists actually created a prediction of our consumption and estimated the time our finite resources would disapear. For a while now I was under the naive assumption that there isn't enough interest or money to fund research about climate change, because it feels like there is no progress. But in reality, it's a really difficult problem to solve and our consumption just keeps increasing. I really want to read the Limits of Growth when I get the chance because it seems interesting.     </p>

<p>This quote, "Commerce can fail us, because money and people sometimes have disagreements about what is valuable" stood out to me. I think it's true that we went from a place of inventing things that are helpful to what products make the most money. It's almost as if all company's has a personal agenda and does not think about the consumer. It's inevitable to avoid money in this economy, but perhap that's why small businesses are preferrred by some. Because they have an intimate connection with their customers and don't want to jepardize their good reputation. While big companies have enough money to "sweep stuff under the rug".     </p>
