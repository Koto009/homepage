<h2>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House | 8. 29. 23 |</h2>
<p>It’s interesting that the article talks about the “current” climate for web design, but this article was written in 2018 and is now 2023. I do believe that the system or laws to facilitate online activity are very outdated and it reminds me that last year there was a significant concern in data security with TikTok and people started to question the other apps. Still, no new data security regulation legislation was put into place. Laurel’s point about, “ we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future”, stood out to me. I watched a documentary on Netflix called Social Dilemma in 2020 when it first came out, and people who used to work at Google admitted that even their emailing system was designed for people to get hooked on it. To constantly have people scrolling and checking their apps, they limit social apps from their kids for fear of online addiction. </p>

<h2>Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology | 8. 29. 23 |</h2>
<p>I read this article last semester in Core Studio 4 and it was nice to reread it after the finished project was made. It reminded me that most people take inventions as granted and that building something from hand is pretty difficult. We rely on lighters to light campfires, but it’s entirely possible to use friction to generate enough heat to light the campfire. When I was building my machine for core 4 last year, I created a rotating stand from cardboard. It was a lot of trial and error from videos from YouTube, but it was satisfying to build something from a simple material such as cardboard.  </p>
