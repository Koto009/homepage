<div class="letter">
    <p>I use to never be able to share the bed. It would be too uncomfortable and I got used to the cold. But now I fall asleep at night imagining that you are next to me. Your warm embrace and the way you hang onto my body as if I would vanish. I would caress your sleeping body and run my fingers through your hair. The night after you leave, I hug the pillow and blanket you used to try to breathe in your scent. My futile effort to try to feel your warmth again.</p>
