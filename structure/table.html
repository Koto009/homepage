<p>Warm soupy aromas fill the air. There’s a sense of nolstagia in the air, I 
remember my mom’s homecooked dishes. I miss her cooking, stopped cooking after I entered middle school, with her long working hours. I can see the fuzzy memories when I cook Korean dishes. I don’t know how to cook traditional recipes without recipes unlike my mom. I hope to collect her recipes soon (between you and me, she never has the same measurements, maybe I need to film the process instead). I don't never want to lose the memories of me helping her cook, I hope I remember the love each time I cook her recipes. </p>
