<p>Where am I?It’s turning night, the sky is a deep dark blue as it slowly gets hazy. I stare out the window of the black sedan while I watch the landscape pass by. We decide to take a break from driving so we park near some sort of market. It looks like the marketplaces from Jeju Island and my family and I walk around. I see those sweet potato fry snacks that I like so we buy a bag. I walk while eating them and we take a turn between stalls. I decide to turn around and my parents are gone. The stalls start to feel like a maze. I take another turn and now Jen is gone. I ask Susan where they all went and she tells me that “they probably went to the bathroom so let’s wait near the parking lot”. By the parking lot, there’s a lone swing with sand underneath, just like any swing at a playground. I ask my sister to push me on the swing and she keeps pushing until I no longer feel her hand on my back. I look behind me and she’s no longer there.</p>
