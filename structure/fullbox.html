    <p>It's loud. The words spiral in my head, simmering in my head. There's another task, I'm sure I will be able to finish all of these one day. If I don't clean the clutter, I will be swept away and buried. Sometimes I just want to lie in the snow, time paused and become part of the many snowflakes on the ground.</p>
