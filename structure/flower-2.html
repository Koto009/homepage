    <p>Textures are everywhere. I see mostly smooth or bumpy and green, because whenever I walk to class everyday I notice the spiky grass and smooth leaves in the trees. I often see squirrels with fluffy tails, they always remind me of coco. Anything really does, coco and her fur in general always calm me down, engulfing me in softness and security. Swirly textures fascinate me, or anything that refracts light. Itâ€™s beautiful to see glass in real life, everytime I stare at it the more it confuses me. The texture at home feels smooth and fluffy, there are blankets and pillows everywhere. I think when I lived in my dorm last year I felt homesick because the place started to feel empty and cold. </p>
